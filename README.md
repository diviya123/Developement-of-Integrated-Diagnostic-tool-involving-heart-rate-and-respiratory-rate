# Developement-of-Integrated-Diagnostic-tool-involving-physiological-parameters-like-heart-rate-and-respiratory rate 

Integrated Diagnostic tool involving physiological parameters like heart rate and respiratory rate using facial image data for long term monitoring
This will involve pi noir camera v2 with an integrated raspberry pi controller to acquire images that would be converted to their respective RGB formats in Matlab tool which would then be used to obtain respiratory peaks and heart rate. The heart rate data is then fed to Kubios tool for analysis on heart rate variability to monitor stress levels. 
raspberry pi 3 with pi noir camera v2 (infrared camera) is used to obtain images and Open Cv tool is used to locate the face and assess the heat map of the face  and optical density from  forehead from which respiratory and heart rate is obtained and fed to Matlab for processing.Optical data is assessed based on the properties of oxyhaemoglobin similar to the principles of photoplethysmograph.
Respiratory rate with heart rate variability obtained from Kubios will help in monitoring stress levels and respiratory capacities of lungs in Covid affected patients
